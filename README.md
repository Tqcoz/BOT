# Welcome to the Downloadable Branch of JSHulkbot.
 This is the branch you can download for you to self-host (not selfbot, just on your local connection). Just beware, this bot is not meant to be a selfbot. I tried that once and it failed badly.
 
 # Welp, for some starting off info.
 You gotta have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org "open NodeJS.org") and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org "open discord.js.org") to use this. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed, and to do that, just look in the package.json and `npm install --save` everything there, and you'll be good. Just replace everything that's `process.env` with what you want, or just make some environment variables and you should be good. [Make sure to give me credit, as I and a few other friends did all the programming for this bot.](https://github.com/FHGDev "Credit Link")
